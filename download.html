  <p>
    This page contains the full Arduino program used to control the robotic arm,
    including forward and inverse kinematics, Cartesian velocity control, and
    singularity handling.
    This code includes a 7 button control layout, 2 for each cartesian direction and 1 that computes
    forward kinematics and compares the end effectors current position to the established home position in the header,
    used for tracking straight line errors and tuning PID controller.
